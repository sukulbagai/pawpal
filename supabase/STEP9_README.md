# Step 9: Admin & Moderation System

This step implements a comprehensive moderation system for PawPal, including user reports, admin dashboard, content visibility controls, and abuse prevention.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### User Reporting System
- **Report Button**: Any signed-in user can report inappropriate dogs
- **Report Categories**: Abuse, spam, wrong information, duplicate listings, other
- **Evidence Support**: Optional evidence URL for supporting documentation
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 reports per 10 minutes to prevent abuse

### Admin Dashboard
- **Reports Management**: View, triage, and action all user reports
- **Dog Moderation**: Hide/unhide, soft delete, and status override capabilities
- **Audit Trail**: All moderation actions are logged with timestamps and notes
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient management of multiple reports and dogs

### Content Visibility System
- **Public Safety**: Hidden and deleted dogs are excluded from public listings
- **Owner Access**: Dog owners can still view their own hidden dogs
- **Admin Override**: Admins can see all content regardless of status
- **Soft Delete**: Dogs are never permanently deleted, maintaining data integrity

### Abuse Prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam on report submissions and dog postings
- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: In-memory rate limiting per user/IP
- **Configurable Limits**: Easy to adjust thresholds as needed

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Tables

#### Reports
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  target_type TEXT CHECK (target_type IN ('dog')),
  target_id UUID NOT NULL,
  reporter_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  category TEXT CHECK (category IN ('abuse', 'spam', 'wrong-info', 'duplicate', 'other')),
  message TEXT,
  evidence_url TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'open' CHECK (status IN ('open', 'actioned', 'dismissed')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Moderation Actions
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.moderation_actions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  report_id UUID REFERENCES reports(id),
  actor_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  action TEXT CHECK (action IN ('hide-dog', 'unhide-dog', 'soft-delete-dog', 'override-status', 'dismiss')),
  notes TEXT,
  meta JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Modified Tables

#### Dogs (Added Moderation Columns)
```sql
ALTER TABLE dogs 
  ADD COLUMN is_hidden BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

### Setup Admin User
1. Create a regular account in the app
2. In Supabase dashboard, go to Table Editor ‚Üí public.users
3. Find your user and change `role` from 'adopter' to 'admin'

### Test Report Flow
1. **As Regular User**:
   - Navigate to any dog detail page
   - Click "Report" button
   - Fill out form and submit
   - Verify success toast

2. **As Admin**:
   - Navigate to `/admin`
   - Go to Reports tab
   - Find the report and take action (Hide dog)
   - Verify dog disappears from public listings

### Test Visibility Rules
1. **Public View**: Hidden dogs don't appear in listings
2. **Owner View**: Hidden dogs appear with "Hidden" indicator
3. **Admin View**: All dogs visible with status pills

### Test Rate Limiting
1. Rapidly submit >10 reports within 10 minutes
2. Should receive HTTP 429 error
3. Wait for rate limit window to reset

- Implement report analytics dashboard

### Future Enhancements
- Automated content moderation using AI
- Bulk moderation tools for admins
- Appeal process for moderated content
- Community moderation features

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Admin Access Denied
- Verify user role is set to 'admin' in public.users table
- Check JWT token is valid and not expired
- Ensure admin middleware is properly configured

#### Reports Not Visible
- Check RLS policies are properly configured
- Verify reporter_id matches authenticated user
- Ensure admin role is correctly set

#### Rate Limiting Issues
- Check rate limit configuration in middleware
- Verify user authentication for proper rate limiting
- Clear rate limit store if needed for testing

#### Dogs Not Hiding
- Verify moderation action was properly logged
- Check dog visibility queries include proper filters
- Ensure frontend refreshes data after actions

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check moderation tables
psql -d postgres -c "SELECT * FROM public.reports LIMIT 5;"
psql -d postgres -c "SELECT * FROM public.moderation_actions LIMIT 5;"

# Verify dog moderation columns
psql -d postgres -c "SELECT id, name, is_hidden, deleted_at FROM public.dogs LIMIT 5;"

# Check admin users
psql -d postgres -c "SELECT id, name, email, role FROM public.users WHERE role = 'admin';"
```

Step 9 implementation is complete and ready for production use! üõ°Ô∏è‚ú®
